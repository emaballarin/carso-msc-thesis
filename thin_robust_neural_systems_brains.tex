\begin{frame}{\protect{\emoji{brain}} Recall, introspection... \textit{robust AI}?}

    Indeed, \textit{brains} may be the \textit{only} practical realisation of a system with the \textit{robustness} properties we look for...

    \begin{block}{\protect{\emoji{light-bulb}} A guiding idea}
        Is it possible to loosely inform the development of \textit{robust} DL systems with (grossly simplified, idealised) descriptions of \alert{neurocognitive} phenomena?

    Getting inspiration from the ideas of  \textit{\alert{recall} of acquired information}, and \textit{\alert{introspection}} as \textit{thought about thought}.

    \begin{block}{\protect{\emoji{warning}} Beware!}
        The \textit{modelling} that follows has no claim of \textit{biological plausibility} whatsoever, at this stage! This would be \textit{added value}, though -- and in interesting research direction!
