I would also like -- with a smile on my face, and hoping in yours, too! -- to acknowledge and express my deepest gratitude towards:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{unbound precision} integer numbers implementation in \texttt{Python 3}, which -- though completely unrelated to the realisation of this thesis -- allowed me to seamlessly keep track of\footnote{But, unfortunately, not to \textit{print} anymore -- \textit{thanks} to the controversial fix to \texttt{CVE-2020-10735}. \href{https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95778}{See for reference.}} the number of \textit{thank-you beers} long due to most of the people mentioned right above;

    \item \texttt{[REDACTED]}, whose \textit{full automation} by means of \textit{artificial intelligence} has been a long unspoken goal of mine, a spur at times, and surely a \textit{funny} (well, not really, to remain objective!) story to tell;

    \item The \textit{myself} of $2018$ -- who, after having been masterfully introduced to the field of \textit{adversarial robustness} in \textit{deep learning} -- though with exceptional predictive accuracy: \textit{"I would never work on this, especially defences!"\footnote{Was it maybe the effect of an \textit{adversarial attack}? Nobody will ever know...}.}
\end{itemize}
