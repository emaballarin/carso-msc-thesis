    \underline{An \textit{elevator pitch}}
    \end{center}

    \texttt{CARSO} (\textit{CounterAdversarial Recall of Synthetic Observations}) is a \alert{novel} \textit{deep learning} architecture and training/inference methodology for the improvement of \alert{\textit{adversarial robustness}} in \textit{deep artificial neural networks}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Loosely inspired by high-level \textit{neurocognitive} mechanisms;
        \item Targeted against \textit{\alert{gradient}-based}, \textit{white-box} attacks;
        \item Significant, promising results so far; comprehensive testing still in early stages.
    \end{itemize}
