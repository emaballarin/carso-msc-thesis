\begin{frame}{\protect{\emoji{rocket}} Where did we came from, where do we go?}

    We talked about \texttt{CARSO} -- a novel framework devised to foil \textit{gradient-based adversarial attacks}, specifically targeted at image classification -- showing noteworthy improvements upon \texttt{IAT}, a strong contribution to \textit{off-manifold-to-on-manifold reprojection}, and solid \textit{innate robustness}.

    Experimental scope can be -- and will be! -- broadened, though, to a wider set of \textit{neural architectures}, \textit{types} of data, or more complex, challenging (classification) tasks.

\begin{frame}{\protect{\emoji{rocket}} Beyond \texttt{CARSO}}

    The work required to develop and assess \texttt{CARSO} evoked suggestions reaching far longer and broader than expected. Chiefly, in order of increasing conceptual distance...

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The idea that \textit{adaptive} defences may exist, explicitly steering their behaviour on the basis of the geometric properties of inputs or attacks faced.
        \item Weight-agnostic layers operating at the \textit{feature-specific}, able to produce \textit{zero-gradient} in expectation.
        \item The possibility of informing the development of \textit{deep learning} architectures with neural activity recordings from even \textit{live-subjects}. \protect{\emoji{mouse}}
