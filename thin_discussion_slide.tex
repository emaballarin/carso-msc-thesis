    Within the scope of the experimental analysis performed so far, we consider the results obtained to be \textit{moderately-to-very} \alert{positive}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textit{clean accuracy \alert{toll}} is imposed by the method \wrt \textit{IAT}. Yet, this is to be generally expected, and slight in magnitude;
        \item Against \underline{\textit{foreseen attacks}}: significant -- but not large -- increase in \textit{adversarial accuracy};
        \item Against \underline{\textit{unforeseen attacks}}: very solid performance, clearly beyond \textit{foreseen attacks/defences} transferability. \textit{Innate robustness}
    \end{itemize}

Speculatively: the result of a combined, synergistic effect. However, the lens of the \textit{data manifold hypothesis} may give a more precise analysis: \texttt{CARSO} acts mainly as an \textit{on manifold re-projector}!
